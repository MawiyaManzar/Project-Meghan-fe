## Problem Statement

University students aged 18-24 face a critical mental health crisis. Studies show that:
- **75% of mental health conditions begin by age 24**, with university being a peak period
- **Only 20-30% of students seek professional help** despite experiencing significant distress
- Students often fall into "silent spirals" - periods of escalating stress, anxiety, and isolation where they don't reach out for support
- Traditional mental health resources are often **stigmatized, expensive, or have long wait times**
- Students need **immediate, accessible, and non-judgmental support** that fits into their busy academic schedules

The core problem: **Students need a proactive, empathetic, and accessible mental wellness companion that intervenes before crisis, provides continuous support, and breaks the cycle of isolation.**

## Solution Overview

**Meghan** is an empathy-first digital wellness assistant designed specifically for university students. It combines:

1. **Proactive Triage System**: Identifies students in distress through interactive mood assessment and stress source identification before they reach crisis
2. **AI-Powered Empathetic Chat**: Provides 24/7 support using an "older sibling" persona that's calm, protective, and non-judgmental
3. **Micro-Action Wellness Tools**: Practical, bite-sized tools (Pomodoro, Sound Therapy, Small Promises) that fit into student schedules
4. **Gamified Engagement**: XP and leveling system that makes wellness activities rewarding and sustainable
5. **Peer Community Support**: Anonymous, stressor-specific peer clusters that break isolation
6. **Personalized Context**: AI adapts to each student's unique situation (major, hobbies, values) for relevant support
